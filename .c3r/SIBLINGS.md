# SIBLINGS — auto-regenerated at the start of each iteration

This file is your snapshot of what every OTHER agent in this project
has been doing. Use it at the top of every iteration (after reading
INBOX.md) to stay coordinated.

**To actually read a file from a sibling's branch** (without
checking it out — they're on separate branches to avoid conflicts):
```
git show agent/<sibling-name>:path/to/file
```

**To see what a sibling has changed since you last looked:**
```
git log agent/<sibling-name> --since='1 hour ago' --name-status
git diff HEAD agent/<sibling-name> -- path/
```

**To push a handoff file to siblings:** commit it on your own branch
and reference it in your Discord thread or in your next log entry.
Siblings will see it in their next SIBLINGS.md refresh.

## td_baseline
- **role**: generic
- **focus**: Bootstrap studies/td_error_baseline: set up MetaWorld + SAC with TD-error PER on 2 sparse-reward tasks using Modal for       E  training, instrument the critic to log TD-error distributions and their correlation with a dense-reward oracle advantage over  E  training, and produce a single figure quantifying how (un)informative TD-error PER is in the early training regime.
- **status**: running · iter #1 · ctx 0%
- **last iter**: 8m ago
