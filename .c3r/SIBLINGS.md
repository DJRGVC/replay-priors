# SIBLINGS — auto-regenerated at the start of each iteration

This file is your snapshot of what every OTHER agent in this project
has been doing. Use it at the top of every iteration (after reading
INBOX.md) to stay coordinated.

**To actually read a file from a sibling's branch** (without
checking it out — they're on separate branches to avoid conflicts):
```
git show agent/<sibling-name>:path/to/file
```

**To see what a sibling has changed since you last looked:**
```
git log agent/<sibling-name> --since='1 hour ago' --name-status
git diff HEAD agent/<sibling-name> -- path/
```

**To push a handoff file to siblings:** commit it on your own branch
and reference it in your Discord thread or in your next log entry.
Siblings will see it in their next SIBLINGS.md refresh.

## vlm_probe
- **role**: generic
- **focus**: Bootstrap studies/vlm_localization_probe: collect a small set of MetaWorld failure rollouts on 2-3 tasks, build a thin VLM E  client (Claude + one other) that takes K keyframes plus a task description and predicts the failure timestep window, and run a E  sweep over K, prompt format, model, and task reporting localization accuracy, latency, and cost. Do not touch SAC or replay E  buffers — this study is pure VLM probing.

## vlm_litreview
- **role**: generic
- **focus**: Literature review: survey recent papers (2023-2026) on VLM-based failure detection and localization in robotic manipulation. Focus on which VLMs are used, keyframe selection methods, prompting strategies, and accuracy metrics. Summarize findings in studies/vlm_localization_probe/LITERATURE.md.

## lit_review2
- **role**: generic
- **focus**: Literature review agent. Use WebSearch to find and summarize recent papers (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML 2023-2026, DeepMind, Google) on: (1) alternatives to TD-error prioritized experience replay in sparse-reward RL, (2) VLM/LLM-guided exploration, reward shaping, or hindsight relabeling, (3) foundation-model-based replay prioritization. Write findings to studies/td_error_baseline/LIT_REVIEW.md. Focus on web search and writing — no code, no training.
